# Portfolio
My personal portfolio blog page

User Stories:
1. As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
2. As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my  audience.
3. As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.
4. As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.
5. As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
6. As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
7. As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.
